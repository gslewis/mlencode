Music Library Scripts
=====================

Geoff Lewis <http://github.com/gslewis/mlencode>

A set of scripts for managing my digital music library:

* mlrip.pl      - rips single- or multi-disk albums to normalized wavs
* mlencode.pl   - encodes wavs to ogg, mp3 or flac
* mladdalbum.pl - adds an album to a music device library using hard links
* mlsync.pl     - uses rsync to synchronize a music device library
* mlcommon.pl   - shared functions
* flac2wav.pl   - creates wavs from flac using cdparanoia naming scheme


Configured by the ~/.mlencode.ini configuration file.  Copy the mlencode.ini
sample configuration file and modify as required.
